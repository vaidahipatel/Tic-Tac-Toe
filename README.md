# Tic-Tac-Toe
Tic-Tac-Toe is a two player simple game. The game is played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares.  Each player get "O" or "X" as their mark. Players take turns putting their marks in empty squares.  The first player to get 3 of their marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.  When all 9 squares are full, the game is over. If no player has 3 marks in a row, the game ends in a tie.
